1.Introduction: 

Our project is inspired from facebook game 
crazy taxi and many other game. These days, 
students are more interested in playing racing games. 
They usually spend a lot of time playing those racing 
games. Our idea was also to create such a game not 
exactly a racing game but which includes that sort sort 
of games. 

2. Directions: 
for left -press 1 and enter 

for right -press 3 and enter 

for forward - press 5 and enter 


3. Problem Statement: 
The player which is a car runs over a path 
which contains many obstacles. The player has to 
cross all the obstacles without collision in order to 
cross a level. 

4. Software Requirements: 
Codeblocks with Simplecpp. 
5. Implementation: 
• We have created a path of around 5000 m 
which contains many obstacles (rectangles) 
placed at their respective position. The player 

is being placed at the visible part of the init 
canvas. 


• On the commands given by the player, all the 
obstacles come to the visible part of the canvas 
and passover through the player. 
• The player has to move to the left and right so 
that he does not collide with the rectangle. 
• We have created function left and right in the 
code so that the player moves to the left or to 
the right. 
• Each time a while loop is executed the player 
advances in the forward direction or in other 
words all the obstacles move in the backward 
direction. 
• If the player collides with the obstacle, then the 
game is over. 

6. Testing the Code: 
Our code is designed such that if we give input 1 , 
the player moves to the left. 
SCREENSHOTS 
GAME CASE 1 - LEFT 




NOW GIVE INPUT 1 (LEFT) : 



CASE 2- RIGHT 




NOW GIVE INPUT 2 (RIGHT) 



SOME OTHER SCREENSHOTS OF 
THE GAME 



7. Discussion of Project: 
A)What are worked as per plan? 
• We could make a path of over 5000-6000 
metres length in the initCanvas. We arranged 
all the obstacles in the respective position. 
• Our player is being created in the visible part of 
the init Canvas. 
• On the commands of the player, the player is 
made to move forward or to the left or right 
which was implemented successfully. 
• If the player collides with the obstacle, then the 
game is over. 
• We are effectively creating the score for the 
player depending on the number of obstacles 
he crossed. 

B) Changes made in plan: 
We could not make the time 
implementation in our game and also we planned 
of creating an infinite path. But the creation of 
infinite path actually delayed the game to a larger 
extent. It took much time to complete one while 
loop. 
We additionally added SCORE in our 
project. 

8. Future Work: 
Our game came be extended to a multiplayer 
racing game with a lot of graphics , time 
implementation in the game, also the sound 
implementation.
